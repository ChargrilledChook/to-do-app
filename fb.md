Suggestion: Foundations should have it's own discord channels.

There are several potential advantages to this.

Content and expectations in each channel could be more appropriately set. In general there are many more people equipped to help with beginner questions. Keeping the more advanced content separate could help keep it easier to parse for the people equipped to handle those questions.

As a student having completed the Ruby course and now going through Javascript, I felt a much stronger sense of community, or having a cohort of students going through the content with me, while doing the Ruby course. The channels were generally quieter but also seemed to have much higher engagement from experienced community members, including maintainers and core members.

The Javascript channel by comparison feels very 'busy', less focused, and heavily skewed towards beginner questions. The channels tends to fill up much quicker and are more difficult to parse.
